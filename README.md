# TreeLDDMMCVPR
Repository for CVPR 2022 submission 9224


# tree_space
A module for tree space construction : 
 - VascularTree is a class for which nodes are curves.
 - SubBHV is a class designed to compute from a database of trees the variables needed for the proposed optimization. 

# experiences
- first_synthetic_exp.py : simplest example.
- second_synthetic_exp.py : 3 possible orthants.
- exp_trees.py : experiment with 20 trees and 9 uniques topologies.

# Optimization
Module to optimize both LDDMM and the position in the tree space.
